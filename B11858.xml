            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>When upon juſt grounds (as I humbly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, and am confident) I appealed from Parties and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to your Sacred Majeſtie for iuſtice in ſo waighty a cauſe, as here is preſented before you: I thought long ere this to have had the happines, to have preſented both an humble Petition, and Apologie to my Appeale to your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie, in mine owne perſon. But two cauſes eſpeciallie hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred mee: the one, Gods hand of viſitation in this Citty, which continuing ſo long and great, I durst not make my approch to the Court, and chiefly to Your Maieſties Sacred Perſon, leaſt I might give offence: the other (and which of the twaine is much more perillous to my ſelfe) the Purſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants continuall watch about my dore, threatning to catch
<pb facs="tcp:178268:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> me, and make mee faſt, or run my Countrey (as he ſaith) ſo as I cannot paſſe in or out, without preſent danger. And I confeſse I have ſmall liſt to come into that Lions denne, <hi>Quia me veſtigia terrent:</hi> not that I am affraid of any ſuch ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, as not if conſcious to my ſelfe of any ſuch crime as they lay to my charge; but (as the Apoſtle ſaid in the like caſe) <hi>If I bee an offender, or have committed any thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of death, I refuſe not to dye: but if there be none of thoſe things whereof they accuſe me</hi> (as matter of ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) <hi>no man may deliver mee unto them: I appeale unto Ceſar.</hi> And bleſſed bee God, that I have ſuch a Chriſtian <hi>Ceſar</hi> to appeale unto. Neither yet have I neglected what poſsible, or probable meanes I could uſe in Court (being an old outcaſt Courtier, worne out of all favour and friends there) for the conveying of my ſaid Apologie to your Maieſtie but in vaine. So as being now out of all hope of acquainting your Maieſtie with ſo great a cauſe, by that way and meanes as I deſired: I am at length compelled to give forth copies, in hope at least, that ſome well minded man, or noble ſparke, may upon the ſight thereof (conſidering how neerely it concerneth the peace, ſafety, welfare, and honor of your Maieſtie, and Kingdome) bee inflamed witb ſo much zeale to your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, as overcomming all cowardlie feares, to dare to doe you ſo much worthie ſervice, in bringing a Copie to your Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties hand, that ſo you may therein read the many and great diſaſters and dangers, where into this your Kingdome is in a precipitancie of being ingulfed, &amp; accordingly in your Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cely Prudence provide a timely remedy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before it be paſt hope. And the rather conceived I this way ſo the more neceſſarie, that comming haply into the hands of ſome of your Wiſe and Sage Counſellors, <hi>Davids</hi> friends, they might be a meanes not
<pb facs="tcp:178268:3" rendition="simple:additions"/> onely to bring it to your hands, but the more to ingage your Maieſtie to the peruſall of it; conſidering how many would bee readie to eaſe your Maiestie of ſuch a commoditie: And now, my Gracious Soveraigne, as I have ever bent my chiefe Studies to your Maiestie the beſt and faithfullest ſervice I poſsibly could: ſo I am perſuaded I could not in all my life have had a fairer and fitter opportunitie to expreſſe my fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie to your Maiestie then now, in a caſe ſo important, as if your Maieſtie ſhall but take ſound notice of it, it may prove the happieſt ſervice, that ever a poore ſubiect could doe to his Prince and Countrey. Nor am I ignorant, how buſie many would be to divert your Maieſtie from the Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſuch matters, as this; as if the great affaires of a Kingdome pertained not to the King, but that hee might take his pleaſure, and leave the care of his Kingdome to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. But my Lord the King is Wiſe, as an Angell of God, conſidering whoſe vicegerent hee is, and before whoſe awfull Tribunall he muſt give a ſtrict account, how he hath manna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged ſo waightie a charge of ſo many ſoules committed to his truſt. Againe, what cenſures may I expect of them, who cannot indure to have their deeds brought to the open light? They will be readie to charge me with Popularity, Faction, Sedition, and what not, and all for thus bringing their acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons upon the open ſtage. But firſt, they will (I hope) excuſe me, when they ſhall reflect upon themſelves, and conſider in cold blood how they have provoked mee, by their calling mee forth upon the ſtage, and by their ſtrange moleſting, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting of me, as if I were a fellon, or a traitor: and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, for as much as they declare their deeds, as <hi>Sodome,</hi> and hide them not, and with a high hand maintaine them too, which is the higheſt pitch of all impiety: can they with
<pb facs="tcp:178268:4" rendition="simple:additions"/> any reaſon blame me, for divulging their practiſes, which they ſhame not to peſter your Kingdome, and oppreſſe your good people withall, who therefore have need publickly to be warned of them, leaſt they be ſeduced by them?</p>
            <p>But not to detaine your Maiestie longer, bee pleaſed to read over this my Apologie of Appeale to your Maieſtie, that your Maiestie may both diſcerne the depth of the whole bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe, and may be pleaſed thereupon to reſcue your old ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant out of thoſe troubles, which hee ſuffereth for diſcharging a good conſcience towards God, and your Maiestie.

            <head>TO THE KINGS MOST EXCELLENT MAIESTIE.</head>
            <argument>
               <p>The humble Appeale of me Henry Burton Clerke, from the proceedings lately made in the name of ſome Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, for cauſes Eccleſiaſticall againſt mee, together with an humble Apology of the ſaid Appeale.</p>
            </argument>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE occaſion of my Appeale was upon the reading of certaine Articles unto me by the Regiſter of the Court before Dr. Duke and by his appointment, who there upon ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering to me the ſaid <hi>Henry Burton</hi> an Oath to anſwere to the ſaid Articles, I replied in theſe words, or to the like effect. I humbly Appeale to the Kings Majeſty my Soveraigne and Patron, as my Iudge in this cauſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom I ſhalbe both a defendant and a complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:178268:5" rendition="simple:additions"/> for I hold it unfit, that they who are my Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, ſhould be my Iudges.</p>
            <p>Now the reaſons and grounds of this my Appeale are theſe following: Firſt, the generall matter of the Articles chargeth me with ſeditious preaching; more particularly objecting unto me my Sermons, which I preached to my ſtock on the 5th of Nouember laſt, upon this text of Scripture. <hi>Pro.</hi> 24. 21. 22. <hi>My Son feare thou the Lord, and the King, and meddle not with them that are given to change. For their calamity ſhall riſe ſuddenly, and who knoweth the ruine of them both?</hi> And in the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons ſundry ſpecialties, and thoſe chiefely concerning diverſe Innovations, which my text did naturally lead me to ſpeake of, and to reprove, to the end that my Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners might be admoniſhed to beware of them, in caſe they ſhould ever come to be obtruded upon them; as namely theſe Innovations in the Booke of Common Prayer: Firſt in the Collect for the Queen and royall Progeny theſe words are put out in the later Editions: Father of thyne Elect, and of theyr Seed: as if they would blotte out the King, Queene and the royall Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geny out of the number of Gods elect. Secondly, in the Epiſtle for the Sunday before Eaſter, they have put out IN, and made it AT <hi>the name of Ieſus every knee</hi> &amp;c. Which alteration is directly againſt the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The ſecond booke wherein I ſhowed a notorious alteration, was that, ordered by Parliament to be read on the 5th of November, in the Firſt Collect or Thankſgiving for the happy deliverance of his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty; the Queen, the Prince, and the States of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. For in the former booke it is thus ſaid. <hi>

But in the new book printed 1635. it is thus. <hi>Infatuate their Counſell</hi> and root out that Babyloniſh and Antichriſtian Sect OF THEM, which ſay of Ieruſalem &amp;c. Againe in the old booke it is ſaid. <hi>And to that end</hi> ſtrengthen the hands of our gracious King, the Nobles and Magiſtrates of the Land with judgement and juſtice to cutte of theſe workers of iniquity, whoſe Religion is Rebellion, whoſe Faith is Faction &amp;c. But in the new book they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered it thus. And to that end ſtrengthen the hands of our gracious King, the Nobles, and Magiſtrates of the Land with judgement and juſtice to cutte of THESE workers of iniquity, WHO TVRNE RELIGION INTO REBELLION, AND FAITH INTO FACTION.</p>
            <p>The third Booke, wherein they have made many al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations, is the Faſt-Book ſet forth by your Majeſties Authority in the firſt yeare of your Raigne, and which your Majeſty in your late Proclamation commaunded to be reprinted and publiſhed and read in Churches at this Faſt: Yet notwithſtanding we find theſe alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the laſt impreſsion this yeare in the firſt Collect theſe words are expunged: Thou haſt delivered us from Superſtition and Idolatry, wherein wee were utterly drowned, and haſt brought us into the moſt cleare and confortable light of thy bleſſed word, by the which we are taught how to ſerve and honour thee, and how to live orderly with our neighbours in truth and verity. Alſo they have left out in three ſeverall prayers the mention of the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> your Majeſties only Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, and her iſſue. Alſo the prayer for the Navy, and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:178268:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> the prayer for ſeaſonable weather. And a whole Collect begining thus. It had been beſt for us &amp;c. Alſo in the laſt page. <hi>Order for the Faſt,</hi> are theſe words left out. To auoyd the inconvenience that may grow by the abuſe of Faſting, ſome eſteeming it a meritorious worke, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers a good worke, and of it ſelfe acceptable to God, without due regard of the end &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Againe, they charge me that I ſpake againſt alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of Communion Tables into Altars, and againſt bowing unto them, and againſt ſetting up of Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes over them, and againſt ſaying a ſecond Service at the High Altar at the end of the Chancel, whence the people cannot heare, eſpecially in greater Churches; and againſt putting downe of Sermons in the after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noones upon the Lords dayes, and inſteed thereof no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing allowed, but Catechiſing by bare Queſtion and Anſwere out of the Common Prayer Booke, without expounding the Principles of Religion layd downe in the Creed, ten Commaundements, and the Lords Prayer; ſo that the people and youth eſpecially are left in their ignorance. Alſo they charged me for ſaying, that Miniſters might not ſafely preach of the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of Grace and Salvation, and againſt the Arminians without being troubled for it. Alſo, that Miniſters in Norfolke and Suffolke were ſuſpended from their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry and meanes, for not conforming to new rites and Ceremonies impoſed upon them contrary to the Law of the Land. Theſe things, with ſundry other of like nature, were objected againſt me in the ſaid Articles, which becauſe a Copy cannot be procured from the Regiſters office, I cannot ſo punctually ſet downe; but referre unto the Articles themſelves, remaining with
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:178268:6" rendition="simple:additions"/> the Regiſter of the High Commiſsion. All which Innovations expreſſed, being found by evident proofe to be moſt true, contrary to the Lawes and Statutes of the Realme, the eſtabliſhed Doctrine and Diſcipline of the Church of England, your Maieſties Declarati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Proclamations; and many of them of very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous conſequence, tending to iuſtify and extenuate notorious treaſons and traitors, advance and vſher in Popery, Superſtition and Idolatry, and giving generall diſtaſte to all your Majeſties loyall and faitfull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects, who here upon grow iealous of ſome dangerous plot now in agitation by theſe Innovators, to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine and overthrow both our Religion &amp; good Lawes: yet my mentioning of them in my Sermons meerly out of loyalty and duty to your Maieſty upon that ſolemne day for which they were moſt proper to warne my flocke to take heed of ſuch Innovations, as whereby Popery and Superſtition doe not only craftily creep &amp; ſteale in upon us, but is haled in with head and ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, is charged upon me as Sedition: Here then let your Maieſty be pleaſed to iudge whither this be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Sedition, as for which I ſhould be ſuſpended from my Miniſtry and meanes, and openly defamed as a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditious perſon. As if a Shepherd admoniſhing his ſheep of the danger of the wolfe, or a watchman the City of the approch of the enemy, or a faithfull and vigilant Servant to his Prince and Country, deſcrying Cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning traitors, who under a colour of freindſhip and fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity to the King and State doe practiſe the overthrow of both, ſhould therefore upon the outcry of the wolfe, or the complaint of the enemy, or the recrimination of the Traitors, be adiuged and condemned of Sedition,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:178268:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> for diſcharging that duty, which both God, and his word, and the ſoules of Gods people require of him. Thus much of the matter of the Articles, upon the very reſoltancy where of I was moved to Appeale, as afore<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſayd.</p>
            <p>Againe, for the further illuſtration of the iuſt cauſe of my Appeale, I except againſt the in competancy of thoſe Iudges, who plainly appeare to be both parties in the cauſe, and Adverſaries to my perſon for the cauſe ſake, and therefore both by the Common, Civil, and Canon Law, yea by the very Lawes of God and Nature, which prohibit any man to be a iudge in his owne cauſe, eſpecially when the party is an enemy to him, that is to be iudged by him; and therefore by the Lawes of God and man I have iuſt cauſe of Appeale from them unto your Royall Maieſty. Where in the firſt place, I diſtinguiſh and put a maine difference, between thoſe Honorable Nobles, Iudges, Counſeillors of State, and other Lay perſons of the High Commiſsion, whom I except not againſt, but mention with all honorable and due reſpect, and between all thoſe Prelates, who are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novators (and <hi>eo nomine</hi> as they are Innovators onely) together with all thoſe that have a neere relation unto them, and dependance upon them, as bearing office under them, and hoping for grace and preferment by them, which are the uſuall body of the Court, determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning all cauſes brought before them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, that theſe againſt whom I except, are parties, thus I prove; becauſe the Innovations which I charge the Innovators with, are both done by them, or by their Officers, and alſo they appeare in the cauſe, as Patrons to Defend and maintaine the ſame againſt me;
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:178268:7" rendition="simple:additions"/> ſo as upon the very reading of the ſaid Articles I could not but preſently apprehend, that the laying of theſe things to my charge by way of recrimination, did profeſſedly ingage them parties in the cauſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly, becauſe they are my Adverſaries in the Cauſe, that this is ſoe I prove as followeth. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are Adverſaries to thoſe truthes delivered by me, and charged by them as matter of Sedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me; which notwithſtanding I am ready to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine againſt them with my life, although I never ſo much as once dreamed, that impiety and impudency it ſelfe in ſuch a Chriſtian State as this is, and under ſuch a gracious Prince, durſt ever thus publickely have called me in queſtion, and that upon the open ſtage, not only for the manifeſt truth of thoſe notorious and audacious Innovations contrary to the Law, but alſo (and which I can never ſufficiently admire) that theſe things ſhould be obiected againſt me, which I prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched upon the foreſaid text and day, alledged in the ſaid Articles. <hi>My Sonne feare thou the Lord, and the King, &amp;c.</hi> Wherein, according to my duty, and the text, I ſo much urged and preſſed all maner of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and ſervice to God, and to the King (as all thoſe who heard me can teſtify) earneſtly admoniſhing Gods people and the Kings Subiects to beware, and not to meddle with ſuch Innovators, (as according to my text) are enemies of God and of the King, and divide between the King and his people.</p>
            <p>Secondly, they againſt whom I except, as aforeſaid, are my Adverſaries, in that they uſurpe ſuch a title of their Iuriſdiction, as cannot conſiſt with that title of Iuriſdiction, which the Law of the Land hath annexed
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:178268:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> to your Imperiall Crowne, from whence all maner of Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction what ſoever hath its imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate and ſole dependance and derivation, as appeareth by the Statute of 26. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 1. 37. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 2. 1. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. and 1. <hi>Iac. c.</hi> 25. which repealed <hi>Queen Maries</hi> Act. of repeale of the ſaid Statute of <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. <hi>c.</hi> 2. whereby the ſame Statute ſtandeth now in force. And the ſaid Statute of 1. <hi>Eliz. c.</hi> 1. uniting all manner of Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction whatſoever unto the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall Crowne of this Realme, enacteth the Oath of Supremacy and Allegiance <hi>eo nomine</hi> to that very end and purpoſe, that none ſhould preſume to exerciſe any Eccleſiaſticall Iuriſdiction within this Realme, but by vertue of the Kings Letters Patents, and in the Kings Maieſties name and right: notwithſtanding theſe men againſt whom I except, as aforeſaid, haveing all of them ſeverally often ſolemnely taken the ſaid Oath of Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy and Allegiance, &amp; being undoubtedly bound thereby, doe continually exerciſe their Epiſcopall Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction without any ſuch Letters Patents of your Maieſty, or your Progenitors in their owne names and rights only, and not in your Maieſties name and right, to the manifeſt breach of their Oathes aforeſaid, and to the manifeſt vſurpation of your Maieſties right, and in high contempt of your Majeſty contrary to your Maieſties peace, your Crowne, and dignity. And therefore under your Maieſties royall favour I ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all ſuch my Adverſaries, and ſo in compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent Iudges of my cauſe aforeſaid. The rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this very Act, which they thus notoriouſly tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe, is the ground whereupon their Commiſsion in cauſes Eccleſiaſticall is erected, and that principally
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:178268:8" rendition="simple:additions"/> for the better obſervation of the ſaid Act, and the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of all Delinquents againſt it, as appeares by all the Commiſsions Eccleſiaſticall into which this clauſe of the Statute is inſerted. Now if theſe men thus dayly infringe this Act themſelves, and ſoe abuſe that very power and Commiſſion by which they now clame to be my Iudges, in affront of your Maieſties royall Iuriſdiction, what indifferent juſtice I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from them, I humbly referre unto your Majeſties juſt and royall conſideration.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, they who are Adverſaries of God and of the King, are my Adverſaries, But all Innovators either in matters of Religion, or of the Common weale, are Adverſaries of God, and of the King: therefore they are my Adverſaries. The firſt Propoſition noe good Chriſtian, or loyall Subject will deny, but that the Adverſaries of God, and of the King, are his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. And for the other Propoſition, the text proveth it: for Innovators are there oppoſed to the feare of the Lord, and of the King. And thoſe men againſt whom I have excepted, as aforeſaid, either are the Innovators themſelves, or chiefe Authors, Abbetters, or Counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nauncers of thoſe Innovations; and therefore they are my Adverſaries, and ſo incompetent Iudges of my Cauſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, they are my Adverſaries for this reaſon o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> argument. They which are Chriſts enemies, are my enemies. But theſe are Chriſts enemies: therefore my enemies. That they are Chriſts enemies, I prove. They who oppoſe the word of God in the Miniſtry of it, in ſtopping the mouthes of Gods Miniſters and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of them without and againſt all Law, are Chriſts
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:178268:9" rendition="simple:additions"/> enemies. But theſe doe ſo. Therefore &amp;c. That they doe ſo is cleare by their practiſe, which will aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly appeare upon due examination.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, they who are the Kings enemies, are my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. But theſe Innovators, by overturning the State of Religion, in bringing in their new Superſtitious rites and Ceremonies, whereby both God is juſtly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed to wrath againſt the Land, and the peace of the ſame is diſturbed, are the Kings enemies. Therefore they are my enemies. They are the Kings enemies, that openly and affrontingly with a high hand and ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe forhead trangreſſe and oppoſe his Majeſty royall Lawes, Proclamations and Declarations againſt all Innovations in matters of Religion &amp;c. And thereby diſturbe the peace of his Majeſties Kingdome, and weaken the State thereof diſtracting the peoples hearts, by making them both to feele their preſent oppreſſions eſpecially upon their Conſciences, and to feare the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſubverſion of the true Religion by your Majeſties Lawes eſtabliſhed amongſt us. Againe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they who with all their might and maine perſecute and op<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> thoſe faithfull, loyall Subjects, Miniſters and people who moſt plead and ſtand for his Majeſties juſt and royall Prerogative in Cauſes Eccleſiaſticall, his Lawes, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations, Proclamations, and the eſtabliſhed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Religion of Chriſt in the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and moſt oppoſe all Innovations, and enemies to them, muſt needs be the Kings enemies. But thus do thoſe from whom I Appeale. Therefore they are the Kings enemies, and ſo myne. This ſuffice to prove thoſe my Adverſaries, and ſo incompetent Iudges of me and of my Cauſe.</p>
            <pb n="11" facs="tcp:178268:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> Finally, I have juſt cauſe to Appeale from thoſe Commiſſioners excepted againſt unto your royall Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, for their illegality, which I have obſerved in their Proceedings partly in their uſuall practiſe, and partly in this preſent cauſe. Firſt, for their uſuall practiſe, and that in adminiſtring the Oath, which they terme <hi>Ex officio,</hi> in which they tranſgreſſe in theſe particulars. Firſt, in inforceing the ſame upon men before any Copy given them of the Libel or Articles exhibited againſt them, yea for the moſt part before any Articles drawne, upon their very firſt appearance: whereas in all other your Majeſties Courts of Iuſtice, noe Oath is either exacted or adminiſtred, till after a Copy of the Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or Bill delivered to the party and his anſwere thereunto drawne up and ingroſſed by adviſe of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſell upon the putting in of his Anſwere into the Court and not before: which as it is contrary to the very Commiſſion itſelfe, which expreſſely limits them to adminiſter Oathes in ſuch manner and forme as is uſed in the Chauncery before the Maſters thereof, where no man is forced to take an Oath, till the putting in of his Anſwere to the Bill on Plaint againſt him: So as it deprives him of the uſe and benefit of Law, by way of demurrer unto the Articles, if there be occaſion; no party being in forced, either in Star-chamber, or any other Court of Iuſtice in the Realme, to take anſwere, where there is juſt cauſe of Demurrer, but puts in a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>murrer by adviſe of counſell, without any Oath at all. And his ſo taking of a raſh Oath, is directy againſt the 39 Article of our Religion: <hi>Of a Chriſtians mans Oath:</hi> In theſe words: <hi>As we confeſſe that vaine and raſt ſwearing is forbidden Christian men &amp;c. So we judge, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:178268:10" rendition="simple:additions"/> 
               <hi>Religion doth not prohibit, but that a man may ſweare when the Magiſtrate requireth in a cauſe of faith, and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſo it be done according to the Prophets teaching juſtice, judgement and truth:</hi> Now ſuch ſwearing to what a man knoweth not, is vaine and raſh. It is alſo againſt fayth and charity, when the Oath is extended to accuſe a mans ſelfe, or his neigbour unlawfully. Secondly in makeing the Oath which they adminiſter, an uſuall ſhare to thoſe which take it. For although it be preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that thereby they are bound to anſwere to Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles in Court againſt them no further then the Law of the Land bynds them, yet being taken, they preſſe it upon the mans conſcience to anſwere in thoſe things, which neither Law nor conſcience bynds him unto. And in caſe he ſhall except againſt any Article, as not bound by Law to anſwere it, then they take it <hi>pro con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſo,</hi> and ſo (although it be for accuſing himſelfe, or others, wherein he ought not, being a breach of charity and of that <hi>Maxime, Nemo tenetur prodere ſeipſum:</hi> and contrary to all Lawes of God and man) they illegally proceed to Sentence without any juſt or further proofe of the things objected.</p>
            <p>Moreouer, their proceeding is illegall, in that the Deponent is not permitted to have a Copy of the Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles againſt him, and to anſwere them by the adviſe of counſell, as in all other Courts of Iuſtice within the Kingdome hath ever been uſed, but muſt make a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine anſwere without adviſe of counſell, wherein men commonly through ignorance of the Law, ambiguity of certaine termes, and captious Interrogatories, are inforced to inſnare themſelves even in caſes wherein they are Innocent.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:178268:10" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> Beſides all this, after their firſt Articles, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they often draw men unto the Oath, when they ſee they cannot have the advantage, of them, thereby, they put in Additionals, and Additionals upon Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditionals contrary to the courſe of Iuſtice in all other your Majeſties Courts within the Realme, which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitt of no Addition to the firſt Bill, Indictment, or Information exhibited, after anſwere given to it, leaſt cauſes ſhould be infinitely protracted, and men conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually vexed, whereby many of your Subjects are there intolerably grieved and oppreſſed, their cauſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted, expenſes multiplied, and ſo never given over or diſmiſſed the Court, till they have brought them into their lurch. And in fine, their impoſing of fines, and impriſoning in ſuch caſes and for ſuch matters, as they neither may nor ought to doe by Law. Thus for their illegalities in their uſuall pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
            <p>Secondly, their illegality in this their procee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding againſt me in particular is a juſt cauſe of my Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peale; which conſiſt of two particulars: Firſt, in the ſubject matter of the Articles objected againſt me, which themſelves terme therein Sedition, of which (admit it true) yet they have no cogniſance in point of Law; Sedition being no Eccleſiaſticall offence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Church, but a Civil againſt the King and State; and therefore to be tryed only in your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Courts of Civill Iuſtice, and not before the Eccleſiaſticall Commiſſioners, who have no cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance of it. And therefore the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> when he was moſt unjuſtly accuſed (as I am now) by <hi>Ananias</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:178268:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> the High Preiſt with the Elders, and Tertullus their Advocate, that they had found him a peſtilent fellow, and a mover of <hi>Sedition</hi> among all the Iewes through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, and a Ring-leader of the Sect of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarens <hi>(Acts</hi> 24. 5.) they did noe convent him before them in their <hi>Eccleſiasticall</hi> Conſiſtory, but before Fae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix the Governour a temporall Magiſtrate, knowing well, that Sedition was not an <hi>Eccleſiaſticall,</hi> but a Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill offence, of which Paul there purged himſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being put to any <hi>Ex officio Oath,</hi> putting them to prove the crime objected by witneſſes, ſaying, <hi>Neither can they prove the things, whereof they now accuſe me:</hi> as I preſume my Accuſers likewiſe cannot doe in any Court of Iuſtice againſt me. Since therefore they are ſoe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt as to queſtion and Article againſt me for Sedition, of which they have no cogniſance, I conceive it to be a <hi>gravamen,</hi> and ſo a juſt cauſe of Appeale from them.</p>
            <p>Firſt, in the manner of their proceding againſt me, which hath been very exhorbitant, illegall, and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary, in theſe particulars- Firſt, in ſerving me with a Citation to appeare only before one ſingle Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioner at his private houſe, when and where there was not then, nor ever hath been heretofore any High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion kept; whereas all appearance are to be made in Court; and there tendering me Articles and an Oath to anſwere to them, contrary to the Law, and their owne uſuall courſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly in excluding my neighbours and friends that accompagnied me thither, out of the houſe, that they might not heare, or ſee what was done, and tende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring me both the Articles and the Oath in a private roome where Dr. <hi>Ducke</hi> and the Regiſter only were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent:
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:178268:11" rendition="simple:additions"/> Whereas all Courts of Iuſtice ought to be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blicke, that all that will may ſee and know their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, in them, and not in a corner.</p>
            <p>Thirdly intendering me an <hi>Ex officio Oath,</hi> to anſwere and accuſe my ſelfe, in a matter of <hi>Sedition,</hi> (which if true) might call not only, my reputation, but alſo my life &amp; liberty into queſtion; whereas Whitgift Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of Canterbury in the Conference at Hampton Court, printed by Authority, there publickly averred, that in <hi>matter of life, liberty or ſcandall,</hi> it is not the courſe of that Court to require any ſuch Oath, or to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force any man that hath taken the Oath, to anſwere to any ſuch Articles. And Paul himſelfe, when he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed for Sedition by Ananias the High Preiſt &amp; Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullus, was neither required nor inforced to take any ſuch. Oath, as appeares by <hi>Acts.</hi> 25.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, in that they would inforce me to anſwere upon Oath, and bring in a Copy of what I publickly preached in my Pariſh Church, which I conceive I am not bound by the Law of God or man to doe, nor ought they to require. For <hi>(Iohn</hi> the 18. 19. 20. 21. 22. 23.) when the High Preiſt asked Ieſus (being convented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him) of his Diſciples, and of his Doctrine: Ieſus anſwered him, ſaying. <hi>I ſpake openly to the world, I ever taught in the Synagogue and in the Temple, whither the Iewes allwayes reſort, and in ſecret have I ſaid nothing. Why askest thou me? Aske them which heard me what I have ſaid unto them. Behold they know what I ſaid. And when he had thus ſpoken, one of the officers which ſtood by, ſtrooke Ieſus with the palme of his hand, ſaying. Anſwereſt thou the High Preist ſo? Ieſus anſwered him: If I have ſpoken evil, beare witneſſe of the evil, but if well, why ſmiteſt thou</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:178268:12"/> 
               <hi>me?</hi> A plaine teſtemony from our Saviours owne Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and Example (which no man can condemne as unjuſt or illegall) that no Miniſter ought to be put ſo much as to give an anſwere, much leſſe a Copy of what he publickly preached in the Church, and that upon Oath to prejudice or accuſe himſelfe thereby, but what ever he delivered, ought to be proved by witneſſes, that heard him: and the High Preiſt being ſatisfied with this anſwere of our Saviour, I hope no High Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioner, but ought to have reſted ſatisfied with the like from me, though as yet they ſtill proceed to preſſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Seventhly, in ſuſpending me againſt all Law and Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, both from my Office and Benefice, in my abſence, as if formerly lawfully convented before them, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing

            <p>Expect not here from mee the Court lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage or dialect; it will not ſuit my perſon, much leſſe the cauſe, which here I preſent to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors; being ſuch a cauſe, as I know not how the Court ſpirit will reliſh it, much leſſe digeſt it. Let me there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be bould, in the firſt place, to awaken thoſe Nobler ſpirits (if haply either layd and luld aſleepe by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantments of theſe preſent times, or otherwiſe ſmothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red under the heape of Court imployments, and the like) yea ſpirits heavenly inſpired, which reſpiring a while, and retiring into the cloſet of your inmoſt Muſe, may ſummon all your cares and powers to the ſad and ſolid eonſideration of a cauſe ſo important, as (all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and conſequences well weighed) I dare ſay, the like hath not come upon the ſtage for theſe many yeares; being a cauſe ſo much concerning the honor of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:178268:13" rendition="simple:additions"/> God, the peace, welfare, and honour of the King, the State of Religion and of the Commonweale by good Lawes eſtabliſhed, the liberty of our conſciences, and the honour of your Lordſhipps, being Peeres of the Realme, Counſellors of State, and ſo pillars of the Kings Throane, of Religion, and of the Republique; all which doe now exceedingly ſuffer, and are terribly ſhaken, yea ready to fall to ground, if not prevented by ſome ſpeedy and effectuall remedy. And whence ſhould remedy be expected, but (next unto God) from his Sacred Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and from his prudent and faithfull Counſellors of State, the great chariots and horſemen of Iſrael? To the end therefore, that his Majeſtie may take notice of ſo weighty a cauſe in hand, and lay it to heart, and ſtrengthen his hands with Iuſtice to vindicate his honor therein, I have humbly addreſſed my ſelfe to his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie both by petition and Appeale, and next to your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors by way both of information and of ſollicitation to give your eyes no ſleepe, till you have effectually moved his Majeſty to a ſerious conſideration of ſuch a cauſe, that ſo neerely concerneth the weale or woe of this Kingdome. Not that I take upon mee to judge of ſuch high matters, but that his Majeſty would bee pleaſed to weigh the cauſe in the juſt ſcales of his mature wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and unpartiall judgement (all reſpect of perſons layd aſide) and alſo conſult his ſage Senators therein, that ſome thing may bee forthwith reſolved on, and ſet on foot, for the preventing (if poſsible) of the immi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ruines both of Church and State: Nor let this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be contemned, becauſe it commes from ſo meane a perſon, as (in the worlds opinion) a poore Miniſter of Chriſt. Certainly, I am one of the watchmen of Iſrael
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:178268:14" rendition="simple:additions"/> (though the meaneſt) yet one who hath obteined mercy to bee faithfull. Nor have I inconſideralty or raſhly ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed upon this buſineſſe, but have been by a ſtrong hand drawne into it. Yea, my Lords, knowe aſſuredly, that Chriſt himſelfe, my great Lord &amp; Maſter, hath called me forth to be a publique witneſſe of this great Cauſe, who will certainely mainteyne both it and me againſt all the Adverſaries of God and of the King. And being ſo, doth not the ſame Lord Ieſus Chriſt, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, call both the King, your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors and all his Nobles and worthies to lay to heart ſuch a cauſe as this, if with the whole Realme you will not be brought backe againe under the Papall and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſtian yoake, which, where euer it co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth, Lordeth, and tyrannizeth over ſoules, bodies, conſciences, goods, lawes, and Liberties?

Certainely if wee thus ſit us downe, and hide us under the hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, while the Romiſh Pyrates doe ſurpriſe our Ship and cut our throaths, and caſt us overboard, what volumes will be ſufficient to Chronicle to poſterity the baſeneſſe of Degenerate Engliſh Spirits, become ſo unchriſtianized, as to ſett up Antichriſt above Chriſt, and his annoynted, and to ſuffer our ſelves to be cheated and noſe-wiped of our Religion, Lawes, Liberties, and all our Glory, and that by a ſorte of

All the world ſeeth in what a diſtracted eſtate things doe ſtand, and what a cloude of divine diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure hanges over us, how ill wee thrive in our affaires how heavily the chariots are driven.

Certainely, if ſuch be ſuffered to goe on thus, as they doe, God muſt needs deſtroy us. Therefore my honorable Lords, give me leave againe and againe to preſſe this upon your Honors, as a mayne ſervice which you owe both to God, to the King, to Religion, and ſo to your Poſterities, and to the whole State that your Honors will uſe your beſt meanes throughly to acquaint and poſſeſſe the King with this weighty buſineſſe; That upon the ſight thereof his wiſedome, directed by Gods ſpirit, may finde out a ſpeedy courſe for the removing of thoſe intollerable greivances under which his whole Kingdome groaneth,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:178268:16" rendition="simple:additions"/> ready to ſinke, and to breath out its laſt. And what e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the preſent neceſſities be, this I am perſwaded of, that never could a fayrer opportunity be taken, if well followed, to vindicate his Maieſties honor, and to make him the moſt happy &amp; glorious King in Chriſtendome, when cloſing with God and with his good people, hee ſhould at leaſt reduce into order the troublers of Iſrael. Now the Lord our God fill your heroical hearts with underſtanding, zeale and courage, that you may acquitte your ſelfes as good Chriſtians towards God, faithfull Counſellors to the King, and true Patrons of the true Religion, and ſo ſtrong pillars of the State, in this cauſe of God and of the King; That ſo after many honorable dayes heere, you may be crowned with ete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rnall glory in the Kingdome of heaven, which is the pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of</p>

You will ſay, why doe they not complaine to us?

But I hope better. And if none be found to plead this cauſe of God, I hope your Worſhips will give me leave (according to the right of law) to plead it, and your ſelves will give true judgement. For as I am Chriſts Miniſter, ſo I am the Kings faithfull ſubject, &amp; crave juſtice at your hands according to the Kings lawes, and oathes.
